# How to Get Unbanned on Palworld (2025 Guide) 🌍🚫

Getting banned from Palworld can be super annoying, especially if you swear you were just peacefully farming or taming cute creatures. This quick guide will help you figure out what to do if your Palworld account got banned and how to appeal like a pro to boost your chances of getting back in the game.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban magically haunt your new Palworld account too? Or are you locked out no matter what device you try? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means Palworld has locked your PC’s hardware fingerprint, making it tough to jump right back in with fresh accounts.

Check your emails or any Palworld notifications for the ban reason. Typical ban triggers include:
- Cheating or using sketchy mods  
- Toxic behavior, spamming, or harassment  
- Account sharing or suspicious login activity  

**Tip:** Always skim through Palworld’s Terms of Service before firing off an appeal.
